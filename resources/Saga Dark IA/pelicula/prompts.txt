On the left side, there's a human figure seated on the ground, profiled to the right, with distinctive spiky hair, wearing simple clothing that consists of wraps or furs. In the center, there's a campfire with dynamic flames and a few logs underneath to suggest a controlled fire. On the right side, a larger figure is seated, holding a staff with a crystal or gem affixed to the top, possibly a shaman or tribal leader, characterized by a large cloak and a hood. The figure's posture suggests they're in deep thought or performing a ritual. Around the scene, include cave walls adorned with simple drawings or carvings and a rough, rocky floor indicative of a natural cavern.
